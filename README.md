# Intro

This is the accompanying code example for my [post on Medium](https://medium.com/p/cee2170a7500).

Contained within is a minimal example of using JSONP with Elm 0.19. Just a little bit of Elm with a dash of regular JavaScript.

# Install and Run

1. Download and install [Elm 0.19](https://elm-lang.org/).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `elm make` from a terminal at the root of this directory.
4. When the compile finishes, run `elm reactor` and open up [index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

If you don't want to recompile or run into issues, the compiled versions are already included in this repo; just skip step #3.
